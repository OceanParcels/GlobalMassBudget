The '*_concentration.csv' files give the plastic concentration in terms of #/m3 and g/m3. 
The '*_total.csv' files give the total number/mass of items in a given grid cell. 
Files with '_f_' contain fishing related item concentrations specifically. And '_mass_' / '_num_' files give the quantities in terms of mass and number of particles.
Results are available for 2015, 2020, and 2025 (projected values, assuming a similar increase in the amount of pollution as last decades (+- 4% increase per year, see manuscript))
